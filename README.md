# Go Container Extension



# Description

The Go Container is an extension with a bunch of packages
like single list, dict, list, stack...which will provide much 
more feasibility for data storage and management than the few 
packages that are already present in the src of golang today.
Most likely the underlying operations towards these containers
will be supportive as many data types as possible whereby they
would implement expecting data control on high level software. 


It is a good practice to support data structure with the effecient
algorithm so that the users could pick up the appropriate type
to manage their data in their dedicated software development. This
usually takes place in other languages like python/c++/java but so far
container in golang is not adequate to support this requirement.


Note this is only for golang programming practice but rather than
the formal software launches, thus if possible, more testing on 
each container or structure is needed before any commercial usage.
