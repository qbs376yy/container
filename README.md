# Go Container Extension



# Description

The Go Container is an extension with a bunch of packages
e.g: list, dict, synchronized map, stack...Other than invention
of new wheels, these packages will definitely provide much
more feasibility for data storage and management than the few 
packages that are already present in the src of golang today.
Most likely the underlying operations towards these containers
will be supportive as many data types as possible whereby they
would implement expecting data control on high level software. 


It is a good practice to support data structure management with
the effecient algorithm to wrap different kinds of data which
needs to be manipulated in users' dedicated software development.
This usually takes place in other languages like python/c++/java
but so far container in golang is not adequate for such requirement.


Note this is only for golang programming practice but other than
the formal software launches, thus if possible, more testing on 
each container or structure is needed before any commercial usage.
