# Go Container Extension



# Description

The go container is an extension with a bunch of packages
like single list, dict, list, stack which will provide much 
more feasibility for data storage and management. Most likely
the underlying operations towards these containers will be
supportive as many data types as possible that implement the
expecting data control. 


It is a good practice to support data structure with the effecient
algorithm so that the users could pick up the appropriate type
to manage their data in the dedicated scenarios. This would always
take place in some other languages like python/c++/java but for now
container in golang is not adequate to support this requirement.


Note this is only for golang programming practice but rather than
the formal software development, so if possible, the more testing
on each container or data structure is needed before any use case.



# How to use the package?
