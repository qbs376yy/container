# Go Container Extension


# The go container is an extension with a bunch of packages
# like single list, dict, list, stack which will provide much 
# more feasibility for data storage and management. Most likely
# the underlying operations towards these containers will be
# supportive as many data types as possible that implement the
# expecting data control. 


# It is a good practice to support data structure with the effecient
# algorithm so that the users could pick up the appropriate type
# to manage their data in the dedicated scenarios. This would always
# take place in some other languages like python/c/java but for now
# container in golang is not that adequate with this requirement.


# Note this is only for golang programming practice but rather than
# the formal software development, so if possible, the more testing
# on each container or data structure is needed before any use case.
